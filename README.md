# Learning Django — Deep Dive

Hi — I'm Niva patel. This repository documents my journey learning Django deeply: hands-on experiments, notes, small projects, and reference snippets I build while studying the framework. My goal is not only to follow tutorials but to understand how Django works under the hood and how to build maintainable, secure, and production-ready web applications with it.

## What you'll find in this repo
- Guided notes and explanations for core Django concepts: models, queries, ORM internals, migrations, views, templates, forms, and admin customization.
- Mini projects and example apps that demonstrate real features (authentication, permissions, file uploads, background tasks, APIs, websockets).
- API examples using Django REST Framework and best practices for designing RESTful endpoints.
- Tests and testing strategies: unit tests, integration tests, and how to use Django's test client and factories.
- Deployment notes: configuration for Gunicorn, Nginx, environment variables, static/media handling, and basic CI/CD examples.
- Security and performance: common pitfalls, XSS/CSRF protections, query optimization, caching, and profiling tips.
- Advanced topics: middleware, signals, custom management commands, async views, Channels for websockets, and database transactions.

## Why I’m doing this
I want to reach a level where I can:
- Confidently design and maintain Django applications in production.
- Understand the framework internals to debug tricky issues.
- Apply best practices for security, scalability, and maintainability.
